            <P>A charitable donation is a gift of cash or property made to a nonprofit organization to help it accomplish its goals,
            for which the donor receives nothing of value in return. It’s very popular for companies to initiate corporate donations to charities throughout the year as corporate social
            responsibility. So let’s find out if your non-profit organisation has already benefitted from the many forms of
            corporate fundraising. Taxpayers may deduct charitable donations of up to 60% of their adjusted gross incomes.
            Charitable donations to individuals, no matter how worthy, are not deductible.With volunteer grants, or “dollars for doers,” companies gift grants to nonprofits where their employees volunteer. To
            capitalize on the opportunity, make sure all your most active volunteers know about the programs and ask them to check
            their eligibility. They direct their funding to meet the needs of low-income communities, with a particular focus on revitalizing
            neighborhoods, educating the workforce, and addressing basic needs like hunger and homelessness </P>
